# Snipping & Front Run Contract bot

BSCTokenSniper is a bot written in Python or Javascript to detect new PairCreated events in the Binance Smart Chain (when a liquidity pair has been created) and buy the token. It is quite reliable and works well.

Front-running bot is a bot which it can do type of market manipulation where an entity can enter into a transaction in advance of a pending or incoming order that will or may impact the price of the order.

# Test

1) IF you want to TEST the bot using BNB / BUSD, then ADD the BUSD custom token to your MetaMask (0xe9e7cea3dedca5984780bafc599bd69add087d56)

2) Run the bot using the to_Purchase value of the BUSD token contract. This works because liquidity is frequently added to this pool.
